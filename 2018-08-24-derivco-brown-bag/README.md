The talk slides are available [here](https://datawookie.github.io/talk-first-steps-with-stan/).

## Presentation

To create a standalone version of the talk for presentation, remove the `reveal_plugins` from the YAML header and change `self_contained` from `false` to `true`.

Rename the resulting file to `index.html` and commit to the repository.

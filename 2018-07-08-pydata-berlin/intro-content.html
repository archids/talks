        <p>Python versus R. R versus Python. Why are these two technologies, each an excellent tool in its own right, often viewed as rivals?</p>
        <p>Data Science is a field divided. There is a Python camp and a R camp. Each believes that their tool is superior.</p>
        <p>I believe that it's not the tools that are divergent. It's the people.</p>

        <p>But apparently there's no middle ground.</p>
        <p>However, even the most ardent R user might find himself wishing that he could access the Object Oriented capabilities of Python.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the most rabid Python user might yearn for access to the wide range of statistical distributions available in R.</p>

        <!-- Idea from https://www.activestate.com/blog/2016/02/r-vs-python-false-dichotomy. -->
        <p>Presenting R and Python as opposing solutions is a flawed dichotomy: there is no reason why they should be adversaries. Ideally they should be working together, side by side, hand in hand, to help you achieve your analytics goals.</p>
        <p>If you're thinking about Paul McCartney or Stevie Wonder right now, it's no coincidence.</p>
